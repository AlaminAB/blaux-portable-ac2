        <h2>The easiest way to deal with excess heat and dry summer air</h2>

        <p>Whether you’re looking for a break from the sun or you prefer cooler temperatures while sleeping, it lets you control the conditions for improved work, leisure, and relaxation. Unlike traditional fans and <a href="#">air conditioning</a> units, it adds moisture to the air to prevent your skin, eyes, and nasal passages from drying out and becoming irritated.</p>

        <p>The Blaux Portable AC Filters the Air Pollen, dust, and who knows what else is all floating around in the indoor air. And the indoor pollution only gets worse when you’re inside all the time. Even particles from your clothes and hair get into the air. The <strong>BLAUX PORTABLE AC</strong> has a changeable, efficient Water Curtain to trap all these particles before they get blown on YOU.</p>
